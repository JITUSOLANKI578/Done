                the React lifecycle is divided into three main phases:

Initialization phase: This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.
Mounting Phase: This phase begins when a component is created and inserted into the DOM.
Updating Phase: This occurs when a component is re-rendered due to changes in props or state.
Unmounting Phase: This is the final phase when a component is removed from the DOM.
